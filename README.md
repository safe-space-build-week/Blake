"Pitch: Imagine a chat bot thatâ€™s on your side in the fight for mental health! Safespace is an app that will send you messages throughout the day to remind you that you are loved. Ultimately, the only thing that gets you through the day is uplifting content that helps alter your perspective,

MVP: User can log in and set up a variety of reminders as to why they, themeselves, recognize what makes them great. Users can create a profile, and add messages to their profile. Can Create, Read, Update and delete message data. Once your messages to yourself are complete, you'll submit them to be sent to you via Text messsage throughout the day. Use Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) to set up the messaging services necessary for your app to send out the reminders.

Stretch Goal: Allow a 2nd user type to be able to log in and select your profile based on an invitation. They can Create, Read, Update and Delete messages to send you as a part of your daily reminder as to why you're amazing.

Mobile: Instead of Twillio, use notifications to send these messages"
